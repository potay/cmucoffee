CMU Coffee Preordering System
=============================

What is it?

The CMU Coffee Preordering System is a way for students from Carnegie Mellon University to pre-order their coffee before going to the cafe stands to retrieve their coffee. This aims to reduce waiting times for coffee, long lines, streamline the payment system as well as provide customers and staff with a friendly and enjoyable experience, so that they can just worry about enjoying their coffee.
